# Daily Note - CLI Note Writer

Daily Note / **daily** is a CLI note writer that just works. Its quick and like that. I like to write notes/todos as quickly as possible before forgetting
something important and just stores it for later.

It's nothing impressive but damn its useful.

## Usage

``` 
    daily write todos.25.07.08  # This allows you to write a note in markdown right from the terminal(duh) 

    daily get todos.25.07.08.md # Outputs the content of the note
    
    daily list # Lists all your notes(again, duh) 
``` 

### Creator Notes 

Daily it's a WLR(Write-Read-List) a afternoon project, if you're going to critize it, fuck you.
